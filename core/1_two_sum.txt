Problem: Two Sum
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum

Explanation:
To solve this question, we take the complement (target - num) and check if it exists in the hashmap.
If it does, we return the indices. If not, we add the current number to the hashmap and continue.

Key Notes:
- Use enumerate or range(len(nums)); num = nums[i] in loop
- enumerate produces (index, value) pairs

Time Complexity: O(n) — one pass through the list
Space Complexity: O(n) — worst case, all elements are added to the hashmap
