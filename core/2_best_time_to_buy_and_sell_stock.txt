Problem: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock

Explanation:
We keep track of the minimum price. When a higher price appears (a jump), we calculate the potential profit.
If itâ€™s greater than the current max profit, we update it.

Key Notes:
- Always try to track the minimum as you go
- Calculate max_profit only on a price 'bump'

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
