Problem: Move Zeroes
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes

Explanation:
Use a pointer `_pos` to track where the next non-zero value should go.
For every non-zero, place it at `_pos` and increment `_pos`.
After that, fill the rest of the list with zeroes starting from `_pos`.

Key Notes:
- We only move `_pos` when encountering non-zero
- Use range(pause, len(nums)) to fill in remaining zeroes

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
