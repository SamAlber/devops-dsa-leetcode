# Leetcode DevOps DSA Prep

This repository contains my curated list of essential Leetcode problems and targeted variations that I'm using to prepare for DevOps-related coding interviews.

The goal is to build mastery in:
- Core data structures & algorithms
- Real-world problem-solving patterns
- Efficient thinking under interview pressure
